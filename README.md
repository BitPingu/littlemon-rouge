# Littlemon Rouge

**Version 3.1**

A command line game developed using Java.

Play the role as a Littlemon Handler, catch Littlemon, train Littlemon, and battle other Littlemon handlers to become the very best. Utilizes object-oriented programming for Littlemon.

Inspired by the Pokémon series.

## Overview

When you enter the game, you are greeted by the mysterious Littlemon Scientist Tim. Here he gets to know a little more about you including your gender, name, and his 
grandson's name which he seemed to have forgotten.

Throughout the game, you will encounter mighty challenges known as dialogue prompts. There are only 1-2 correct options in order to progress through the story. Or else
you will have to start all the way from the beginning of each chapter...

Eventually you will get you meet your very first Littlemon, but soon after your rival seems confident enough to challenge you to a battle...

The battle system is fairly basic. Each Littlemon keeps attacking each other until one faints (dies) and one Handler is declared the victor.

Once you set off on your journey to become the very best like no one ever was, you will come across the dangerous tall grass where wild Littlemon may come out and attack you...

But do not fear! You have your Littlemon with you. With enough luck, you may be able to catch the Littlemon using the Littleballs Tim gave you and add them to your team and to your Littledex.

You may come across other Littlemon Handlers down the road where they could challenge you to a battle. You are able to use the Littlemon you have caught in case your starter faints.

I won't share any specific story details in here, but if you are curious then be sure to check out the game!

Good luck, future Littlemon Master.

## Development

For my Grade 11 Computer Science final assignment, I wanted to build off of a prototype I had developed at a coding club at my high school when I was first exposed to programming in
the context of scripting languages. (unlike Scratch) At the time, choose your own adventure games were a popular project idea since they weren't that particularly difficult to make and 
you can be really creative in the direction of the story with the branching paths. But I wanted to add a twist of my own by adding elements from Pokémon such as a navigational map,
and catchable and trainable Pokémon. (or Littlemon in this context)

With my current skillset at the time, it was practically impossible to incorporate Littlemon, that was until I decided to seek guidance from my teacher on how to utilize object-oriented programming
as what Java is known for which was supposed to be taught in Grade 12. But after discussing my idea, he agreed to lend me his book about Java where I self-taught some concepts from and tried to 
incorporate into my game.

This specific project holds a special place in my heart since it was considered my first big programming project. I hope you enjoy my game!
